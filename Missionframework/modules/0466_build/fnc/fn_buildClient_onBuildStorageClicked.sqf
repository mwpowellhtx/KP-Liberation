        Build factory sector storage container action menu callback.

    Parameter(s):
        _player - the player clicking the action menu item [OBJECT, default: player]

    Returns:
        The CBA event handler has finished [BOOL]

 * side callbacks in the whole sequence of events. Secondary to that, downstream from that
