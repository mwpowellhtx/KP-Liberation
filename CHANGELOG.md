# Changelog

## 0.98.0 (S4) (Under development)
* Added: Client server callback sequence requesting production data when production manager dialog is opened or refreshed. Client _owner_ raises `KPLIB_productionMgr_onRequestProduction` event with _server_, server raises `KPLIB_productionMgr_onProductionResponse` _owner event_ in response with production that is currently under _blufor_ control. Client then refreshes the _production manager sectors_ list box. Client also sets a `_production` variable on the _production manager display_ which can be used for further reference.
* Added: Connected _enqueue resource production buttons_ via _CBA client server events_ being raised. Client raises `KPLIB_productionMgr_onRequestQueueChange`, server responds with `KPLIB_productionMgr_onProductionElemResponse` on success. Otherwise, _notifies clients_ with the result of the requested transaction. Includes respect for `KPLIB_param_production_maxQueueDepth` as well as _factory sector capability_. If a sector does not currently have support for a given _capability_, then those transation requests will be rejected.
* Added: Connected _change production priority buttons_ as well. Everything upstream from the server, then server responses, is in place, pretty much, we think. Always notwithstanding opportunity for tweak, typo or bug correction, of course.
* Added: Additional _production manager_ glue connecting _sector list box selection_ with the rest of the controls on the dialog.
* Added: Added _timers_ support rendering _time remaining_ to `#.##:##:##` string representation. That is, _days_, _hours_, _minutes_, _seconds_, in an extreme case. Minimum possibly format is `##:##`, or _minutes_ and _seconds_.
* Added: _Production manager map_ now responds to _sectors list box_ navigation accordingly.
* Added:
* Removed: Determined that a _production manager apply button_ is unnecessary after all, especially considering we engage _client server sequences_ interactively.
* Tweaked: Adding _production capability_ to _factory sectors_ now also provides _production element response_ for purposes of refreshing _production manager_ UI.
* Tweaked: Updated some _production manager_ UI event handlers a little bit. Tweaked _double click_ behavior for the _status_ and _queue list boxes_, which now _enqueue_ or _dequeue_ pending resources in an intuitive manner.
* Tweaked:
* Refactored:
* Bug:
* Review:

## 0.98.0 (S3) (2021-02-09 20:14:57)
* Added: Added `production manager` UI assets. These build on the core `production` module by adding the corresponding _client side_ UI, along with accompanying _client_ or _server side_ remote callbacks, and other hooks, as necessary. In closing for this sprint, laying out the stubs for the UI was plenty of activity for one sprint. We will save some for the next sprint in terms of engaging with client server callbacks, let alone potential for finite state machine (FSM) considerations.
* Added: Added foundation UI _definitions_, _classes_, etc. These will serve as the basis for all further UI work in the mod. The foundational elements are a work in progress, and very definitely in draft form. They could be reviewed and cleaned up, documentation reviewed, etc. We should probably at least do that before moving too far beyond them.
* Refactored: Fairly non-trivial adjustments in how we define IDD and IDC values for usage throughout. Also upon review, discovered several undocumented mystery identifiers, not sure what these are about. Possibly artifacts carrying over from the legacy code base, but we are not certain. There is also what appears to be at least one mission marker artifact, identified as _vignette_, which is not that but rather an _airspawn_, so that one is equally a mystery. That being said, we are fairly confident of at least value and syntax consistency, as the mission loads. If any of that is out of sync, the entire mission fails to load, sometimes with a glorious exception. All of which, of course, pending some verification, play testing, etc.

## 0.98.0 (S2) (2021-02-05 16:41:04)
* Added: _LINQ_ style support for `.Select(...)`, i.e. `KPLIB_fnc_linq_select`, analog to the `['_element', '_index']` version.
* Added: Timers support, which will be necessary to support _production_, as well as _logistics_, features.
* Added: Established `production` support, starting with sector discovery and production reconciliation with the same. _Reconciliation_ means, allowing for deleted sectors, as well as for additional sectors. The data should remain healhy in the face of those sorts of changes. The key point is that we track in terms of `_markerName` and maintain a base `_baseMarkerText`. The actual `_markerText` that is applied is always calculated based on these two components, plus taking into consideration the sector `_capability` matrix.
* Added: Ability to add _factory sector production capability_. May also be configured by a handful of settings, whether to _debit the nearest FOB_, and _default_ and _target costs_ of the _production capability_ being added.
* Tweaked: Refined the manner in which bits are passed to `KPLIB_fnc_resources_pay`. Similarly, also, for `KPLIB_fnc_resources_getStorages`.
* Bug: Corrected an oversight in the whole _Eden tuple reshaping_, specifically in the `KPLIB_fnc_eden_assetToFlightDeck` chain of custody.
* Refactored: Support for `KPLIB_fnc_notification_hint`. Allows for _client side_ usage, and, just as important, _server side remote_ invocation.
* Refactored: Reshaped the _sectors tuples_, see _docs_: `kp-sectors-tuple-matrix.ods`. Informs both the _Edens_ as well as _FOBs_, for starters. Will soon also be useful for _production_, and in the future informing _logistics_.
  * Was mostly straightforward following the trail of breadcrumbs from KPLIB_sectors_edens and KPLIB_sectors_fobs.
    * Except in a couple of instances such as `KPLIB_fnc_eden_createOrUpdateMarkers` in which we gave element oriented functions defined.
    * Which is to underscore we just need to be careful with this sort of functional shift.
  * On the whole, however, we like this refinement much better than the initial draft.
* Refactored: Renumbered the modules with the introduction of the new ones from previous sprint. Should offer us plenty of room for growth, infilled bits, etc. See _docs_: `a3-kplib-refactor-modules.ods` for more details as to the ordering.
* Bug: Corrected verbiage concerning the `systemTime` formatting function.
* Bug: Handle the use case where serialization occurs for assets beyond the range of known _FOB_ sites. Should never be serialized in the first place, we think, but this is the next best manner in which to respond. Can verify in both `KPLIB_persistence_objects` and `KPLIB_persistence_units` arrays.
* Review: Reviewed bits of the code with regard to building the _FOB building_. We may have a clue as to why bits like _direction_ and _up vectors_ are not being conveyed quite correctly between build confirmation and the building being replaced. But moreover, we think there may be a more general use case for the same sort of functionality, especially as applied to _factory_ and possibly also _township sectors_, _building storage_, and so forth. Not a bridge we will necessarily be crossing today, but could come downstream from here in the next sprint; we want to try to stay focused on just introducing the basics in term of _timers_, introducing the _production_ features, etc.

## 0.98.0 (S1) (2021-02-01 10:35:43)
* Thawed: **From the previous ice age.** (Details in the [Rekindling discussion](https://github.com/mwpowellhtx/KP-Liberation/discussions/1))
* **_Caveat_**: We are adding some bits that we think deserve a dedicated module unto their own, i.e. _UUID_, _LINQ_, and so on. However, that is going to require that we renumber the modules. This is no small effort, so for now we are placing them as we are in the `0216_common` module, however, with _prefixes_ that are unique to their module. Eventually we will renumber them but for now we are holding off on that level of effort.
* Added: _LINQ_ style aggregate and zip functions for use especially as we get further into things.
* Added: _UUID_ creation functions for purposes of uniquely identifying objects in hand. We will use this for sure to help differentiate between _FOB_ and _start base_ locations vis-a-vis _player_ geolocation.
* Added: `KPLIB_fnc_linq_min` function, which yields the _minimum element_ from a _vector of elements_ of _potentially any shape_.
* Added: Or clarified _static_ and _turret_ assets among the armies.
* Added: `KPLIB_param_edenRange` which captures _start base_ range boundaries for _minimum_ or _maximum_ inquiries, i.e. _within_ or _without_, etc.
* Added: `KPLIB_param_assetMoveRange` CBA setting as a way of tuning the behavior.
* Added: `KPLIB_fnc_eden_enumerate` which enumerates the _start bases_ according to known naming convention; defaults to `KPLIB_eden_startbase` or an open range of `KPLIB_eden_startbase_%1` where `%1` is a _zero based index_. Any break in the index short circuits the enumeration algorithm.
* Added: `KPLIB_fnc_eden_createOrUpdateMarker` which does as it says for an Eden tuple; proxies may specify a `KPLIB_eden_markerText` variable, which serves as the map marker text.
* Added: `KPLIB_fnc_eden_select` as the basis to inquire anything about matching _start base proxies_.
* Added: `KPLIB_fnc_eden_selectWithFlightDeck` which enhanced that inquiry relative to a target, usually `_rotary`, object.
* Added: `KPLIB_fnc_math_convertDecimalToBaseRadix` which does what it says, mainly for use with the military alphabet conversion.
* Added: Using `KPLIB_sectorType` instead of simply `KPLIB_respawn`. It adds clarity, and we can identify whether a _start base_ or an _FOB_ is the focus of deployment as well.
* Added: Ability to verify _UUID_ validity.
* Added: _LINQ_ style _first_ and _last_ functions for use in various aspects. Behaves like a hybrid of the baseline _First_ or _Last_ extension method, with _OrDefault_ comprehension, as well as ability to include the _index_ of the _predicated element_.
* Updated: player actions also respond taking spawn point `_flightDeckProxy` under consideration.
* Updated: The event loop for use with the refactored _start bases_.
* Updated: `KPLIB_fnc_respawn_getRespawns` with comprehension of refactored _start bases_ and use of the _military alphabet_ conversion. Changed the formatting to better suit our preferences; i.e. we like a _grid reference_ first, followed by a _text summary_. We could easily see these formats being user specified, but for now it is what it is.
* Updated: The event loop to better comprehend _player_ geolocation, especially discerning between _FOB_ and _start base_ locations.
* Updated: Applying _UUID_ to _start bases_, _FOBs_, and to _mobile respawn_ assets. We will leverage that in order to uniquely identify where _player_ when facilitating things like _menu actions_.
* Refactored: _Start base_ accounting for potentially one or more such proxies.
* Refactored: `heli` instead to `rotary` especially vis-a-vis moving assets to _flight deck_.
* Refactored: renamed `KPLIB_fnc_core_heliToDeck` instead to `KPLIB_fnc_eden_assetToFlightDeck`, which we think better describes. There is more we think we may do around that approach, but we will take the win that this is for the time being.
* Refactored: _potato spawn_ vis-a-vis moving rotary assets, instead as designated by _start base_ `_flightDeckProxy` variable.
* Refactored: `_flightDeckProxy` can be anything, does not need to be _just the potato spawn point_.
* Refactored: **_Any_** _start base_ can potentially support **_any_** _flight deck_, although typically this is a _cluttercutter proxy object_, specifically the _potato spawn point_.
* Refactored: `KPLIB_fnc_common_getFobAlphabetName` instead to `KPLIB_fnc_common_indexToMilitaryAlpha`, which has a broader application we will need approaching _logistics_, etc.
* Tweaked: Eden starting asset algorithm allowing for specification flexibility.
* Tweaked: A few naming conventions, _Anti-Air_ for _Aa_, _Anti-Tank_ for _At_, and so forth.
* Tweaked: Dropping the `KPLIB_respawn` vehicle variable for mobile respawns. This just adds confusion to the `class CfgRespawnTemplate {...}` template. Instead we leverage a `KPLIB_sectorType` variable.
* Tweaked: Mission object variable naming conventions in keeping with `KPLIB_eden_*` convention.
